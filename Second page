<h1> Types of photography </h1>
<p> There around fifty different types of photography ranging from the basics mobile photography which easily is the most popular and convenient in today's society. There is also the most viewed versions of photography for example aerial, modeling, nature, and night. I personally have a range of different photography styles that I enjoy shooting and have a great appreciation for.
<h2> Candid photography </h2>
<p>One style of photography that always intrigues me is candid photography. I find as a photographer that candids are the most rewarding to shoot and reflect on. This photo can simply capture people talking or sharing a laugh without having knowledge of the photo being taken.
